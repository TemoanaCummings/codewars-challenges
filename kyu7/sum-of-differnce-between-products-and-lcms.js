// In this kata you need to create a function that takes a 2D array/list of non-negative integer pairs and returns the sum of all the "saving" that you can have getting the LCM of each couple of number compared to their simple product.

// For example, if you are given:

// [[15,18], [4,5], [12,60]]
// Their product would be:

// [270, 20, 720]
// While their respective LCM would be:

// [90, 20, 60]
// Thus the result should be:

// (270-90)+(20-20)+(720-60)==840
// This is a kata that I made, among other things, to let some of my trainees familiarize with the euclidean algorithm, a really neat tool to have on your belt ;)\


//  My Solution:
function sumDifferencesBetweenProductsAndLCMs(arr){
	var sum = 0;
	for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		var product = arr[i][0] * arr[i][1];
		var first = arr[i][0];
		var second = arr[i][1];
		while (first !== second) {
			if (first < second) {
				first += arr[i][0];
			}
      if (second < first) {
				second += arr[i][1];
			}
		} var lcm = first;
		sum += product - lcm;
	} return sum;
}
